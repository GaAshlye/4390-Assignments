Feature: Update Project Status


   As the Coding Club President, 
   I need the ability to update the project statuses of Coding Club Projects
   so that I can keep track of the projects and inform clients. 

   Scenario: Team X finishes project Y
   Given Team Y finishes all associated project tasks
   When Team Y marks all project tasks complete
   Then Coding Club President marks tasks complete
